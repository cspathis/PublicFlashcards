How do you exit the <tt>erl</tt> shell?	Ctrl+G, q, Enter
How does Erlang represent hex and other non-decimal systems?	<tt>base#num</tt><br><br>For example, <tt>16#b</tt> is 11.
Is there a global scope?	No, variables are restricted to the scope in which they were defined, typically a clause of a function. There's no wider scope that will accept variable definitions.
What is <tt>=</tt>?<br><br>How is it evaluated?	Pattern matching, not assignment.<br><br>The right side is evaluated first and then matched against the left side.
Why do reassignable variables make debugging more difficult?	Not only do you need to find a variable with the wrong value, you also need to figure out when that unexpected value was assigned. Without reassignment the second part of that process is eliminated.
How is arithmetic different in Erlang than in C-like languages?	Integers are exact and arbitrary-size values. Integer division results in floating-point results without truncation.
What are the case rules for atoms?	They begin with a lower case letter, and continue with letters, underscores, or at signs.<br>Atom interpretation can also be forced on other sequences by surrounding them with single quotes.
Atoms can be compared to what in C?	Global constants defined in a header using <tt>#define</tt>.
What are two key differences between C structs and Erlang tuples?	- Tuples don't define a new type.<br>- The members of a tuple don't have names. That can be accomplished by nesting tuples, however.
Why aren't atoms garbage collected?	They have global scope, unlike variables.
How is an unsuccessful pattern match different in Erlang and Prolog?	In Erlang it's an error, while Prolog would backtrack.
What is <tt>_</tt>?	An anonymous variable.
What makes Erlang's <tt>|</tt> syntax more powerful than standard cons?	You can prepend/match multiple elements at once without creating a wrapper list.<br><br><pre>A = [1, 2 | [3, 4]]</pre><br><pre>[B, C, D, | T] = A.</pre>
Name an easy way to get the ascii value of a character known at program-write time.	<tt>$X</tt> where <tt>X</tt> is some character.<br><br>This is <strong>not</strong> a "conversion", just syntactic sugar for an integer.
