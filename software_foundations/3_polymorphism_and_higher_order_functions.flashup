* Polymorphic `list` can be thought of as what?
- A function from `Type`s to `Inductive` definitions.
- A function from `Types` to `Types`.

* How are polymorphic types written?
With the type parameters following the bare name of the datatype.
E.g., `list nat` or `list X`.


* What are the types of the ``polymorphic constructors`` `nil` and `cons`?
`
Check nil.
===> nil : forall X : Type, list X
Check cons.
===> cons : forall X : Type, X -> list X -> list X
`

* How should `forall X` be read in the type of a polymorphic constructor?
As an additional argument to the constructor that determines the expected types of the arguments that follow.

* With respect to polymorphic inductive types, Coq will automatically infer what?
* What won't Coq automatically infer?
Coq will automatically attempt to infer the type of an arguments, even if that type is `Type`.

However, Coq won't automatically attempt to infer ``arguments``, for example to the type parameters of a polymorphic constructor.

* When no inference has been requested, where do you write type argument in a constructor invocation?
* How about in a constructor that is a case of a match on a polymorphic datatype?
You provide the type argument when invoking a polymorphic constructor.

You do not provide the type argument to a polymorphic constructors in a match on a polymorphic datatype. This is because the polymorphic parameter belongs to the datatype as a whole, not to its constructors.

* Underscores can replace what kinds of type information?
- They can replace type annotations. Of course, you could also simply omit the annotation altogether.
- They can replace type arguments demanded by polymorphic constructors.

* How can type argument inference be requested by a user?
At constructor/function invocation use ``argument synthesis``:
`
length bool someBoolList
length _ someBoolList
`

For the remainder of the module, works on functions or inductive definitions:
`
Implicit Arguments length [[X]].
`

* How can type argument inference be requested at definition site?
* This does not work on ...
On function declaration site use curlies, which avoids even the need for underscores on use-site:
`
Fixpoint length {X:Type} (l:list X) : nat :=
  ...  
`

... inductive definitions.

* How can you use explicit type arguments after having requested inference?
Use `@`.

`
(* This fails if inference has been requested.*)
(* Definition mynil := nil nat *)

Definition mynil := @nil nat
`

* What's the difference between `(x,y)` and `(X*Y)`?
`(x,y)` is a 2-tuple ``value``, using special notation.
`(X*Y)` is its ``type``, also using special notation.

It just so happens that `x:X` and `y:Y`.

* Which way does the type arrow associate?
Right.

The following two are equivalent:
`
nat -> nat ->
nat -> (nat -> nat)
`

* What are the type signatures of currying and uncurrying a function?
Currying:
`
(A * B) -> C
A -> B -> C
`

Uncurrying:
`
A -> B -> C
(A * B) -> C
`
* Give the syntax of anonymous functions.
`
fun arg1 ... argN => expr
`

* Define a function that overrides other functions whose domain is `nat`s.
* Give its type.
`
Definition override {X:Type} (f: nat =>X) (k:nat) (x:X) : nat->X :=
  fun(k':nat) => if beq_nat k k' then x else f k'.
`

`
===> override : forall X : Type, (nat -> X) -> nat -> X -> nat -> X
`

* Describe the `unfold` and `fold` tactics.
`unfold` replaces a term with its definitions, "expanding" functions.

`fold` takes the expanded term and packs it back up into a definition. It is much less used.

* What does it mean to say that constructors in Coq are ``disjoint``?
Values built from distinct constructors are never equal.

* What does it mean to say that constructors in Coq are ``injective``?
The only way for two values produced by a constructor to be equal is for them to have been constructed with the same values as functions.

* Describe the `inversion` tactic.
Given a hypothesis `H` in context:
`
c a1 ... an = d b1 ... bn
`

`inversion H` will conclude either:
- If `c` and  `d` are the same constructor then by the inversion property `ai = bi`. Those facts will be added to the context and will be used to rewrite the goal.

- If `c` and `d` are different then by disjointness property we have reached contradiction so the current goal is proved, since ``any`` goal is now provable.

* How can tactics be applied to hypothesis instead of the goal?
Use the `in` keyword.

For example:
`
simpl in H
apply L in H
`

* Explain the difference between ``forward`` and ``backward`` reasoning.
Forward reasoning is just modus ponens:
Given `L1` and `L1->L2` conclude `L2`.
Backward reasoning starts with the goal and reasons about what would imply the goal until a premise or previous theorem is reached.
Given `L1->L2` and the ``goal`` `L2`, consider it proved if `L1` is already known.

* What happens if you `destruct` on an expression instead of a value?
The cases will be equations with the expression and its possible values.

`
destruct (beq_nat n 3).
  Case "beq_nat n 3 = true". ...
  Case "beq_nat n 3 = false". ...
`

* Explain the `remember` tactic.
?

* Explain the `apply ... with ...` tactic.
