How do function signatures associate with respect to partial application?<br>	They associate to the right.<br><br><tt>a -> a -> a</tt><br>is just the same as<br><tt>a -> (a -> a)</tt><br>
If a type parameter uses both arithmetic and ordering it must ...<br>	... be a member of both <tt>Num</tt> and <tt>Ord</tt> since <tt>Num</tt> is not a type of <tt>Ord</tt>.<br>
Partially apply an infix function.<br>	Use sections:<br>Surround the infix function with parens and only supply an argument on one side but not the other.<br>
What's the problem-case of sections?<br>How can you get around it?<br>	<tt>-</tt> means negative before it means minus.<br>Use <tt>subtract</tt> instead of <tt>-</tt>.<br>
What should you do if you're unsure of the type of a function you're writing?<br>	See what Haskell infers using <tt>:t</tt>.<br>
Create a new function that reverses the order of the input function's first two parameters.<br>	<pre>ghci> :t flip<br>flip :: (a -> b -> c) -> b -> a -> c<br></pre>
What's annoying about <tt>length</tt>?<br>	It returns an <tt>Int</tt> instead of a <tt>Num a</tt>.<br>
What happens if you don't put parens around a lambda?<br>	The function body will extend to the end of the line.<br>
How is pattern matching params different in lambdas?<br>	Only one pattern is allowed.<br>
What are <tt>scanl</tt>/<tt>scanr</tt>?<br>	They are like <tt>foldl</tt>/<tt>foldr</tt>, but they report all intermediate accumulator states as a list.<br><tt>scanl</tt> places the final result last, <tt>scanr</tt> puts it first.<br>
What are <tt>foldl1</tt>/<tt>scanl1</tt>/etc?<br>	They do not require explicit starting values. They assume the first (or last, depending on direction) value as the starting value.<br>
Define <tt>$</tt>.<br>What's its point?<br>	<pre>($) :: (a -> b) -> a -> b<br>f $ x = f x<br></pre><br>It's function application with the lowest (as opposed to the highest) precedence. It is typically used to introduce right association to minimize the number of needed parens.<br>
Define <tt>.</tt>.<br>	<pre>(.) :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> c<br>f . g = \x -> f (g x)<br></pre>
In general, the direction of association ...<br>	... cannot be determined from the name of a function alone.<br>
How can composition be used with functions of several parameters?<br>	The functions must be partially applied until each function just takes one function.<br>
What's a common use of composition?<br>	Using partial application in a function whose result is the argument to another function.<br><br><pre>fn x = ceiling (negate (tan (cos (max 50 x))))<br>fn = ceiling . negate . tan . cos . max 50<br></pre>
What is a common overuse of lambdas?<br>	Using a lambda instead of a partially applied function when passing a function to a higher-order method.<br>If the only purpose of the lambda is to introduce a parameter to a function, you probably could have left it off and used partial application instead.<br>
