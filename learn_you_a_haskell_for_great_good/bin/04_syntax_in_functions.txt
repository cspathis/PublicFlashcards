Beware that the cons pattern won't match ...<br>	... the empty list.<br>
Crash the program with a message.<br>	<pre>error "message"<br></pre>
Prove that the comma in list literals is just syntactic sugar for a cons chain.<br>	In pattern matching you can use comma or cons.<br>
Give a name to the expression being matched by a pattern.<br>	As in Scala:<br><pre>name @ pattern<br></pre>
How are guards added to the parameter patterns?<br>Watch out! ...<br>	<pre>pattern<br>    | condition1 = value1<br>    ...<br>    | conditionN = valueN<br></pre><br>... there's no <tt>=</tt> before the first guard.<br>
The last guard is often ...<br>	... <tt>otherwise</tt>, being defined as <tt>True</tt>.<br>
