* How does OCaml support parametric polymorphism?
Expressions can have types that include type variables, standing for an arbitrary type.

* How are type variables written?
Lowercase identifiers starting with a lowercase letter prefixed by an apostrophe.

* Add type annotations to a function declaration.
`
let funcname (p1 : pt1) ... (pn : ptn) : rest = ...
`

The parens are essential.
