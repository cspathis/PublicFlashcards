Define a new exception.<br>	<pre>exception Name of type<br></pre>
What is the type of an exception?<br>What is the type of <tt>raise</tt>?<br>	<pre>exn<br></pre><br><pre>exn -> 'a<br></pre>
Give the <tt>try</tt> syntax.<br>	It's exactly the same as <tt>match</tt>.<br>
Lookup functions that cannot find their element raise ...<br>	... <tt>Not_found</tt>.<br>
Functions can reject bad arguments with ...<br>	... <tt>Invalid_argument</tt>.<br>
What is <tt>Failure</tt>?<br>How is it different from <tt>Invalid_argument</tt>?<br>Which is typically handled?<br>	An exception for bad arguments less severe than <tt>Invalid_argument</tt> or not the result of programming errors.<br><br>It takes an error string, typically the name of the function doing the raising.<br><br>It is only typical to handle <tt>Failure</tt>.<br>
If no pattern is matched, what happens?<br>	A <tt>Match_failure</tt> is raised.<br>
Describe assertions.<br>	<pre>assert(cond)<br></pre><br>Raises an <tt>Assert_failure</tt> if the condition fails.<br>
Name the errors resulting from lack of memory or stack space.<br>	- <tt>Out_of_memory</tt><br>- <tt>Stack_overflow</tt><br>
Name some non-typical uses of exceptions.<br>	- Reduce memory usage.<br>- As a break statement.<br>- To create <em>finally</em> semantics.<br>
How can exceptions reduce memory usage?<br>	Needless reconstruction of the input can be avoided on unsuccessful runs of functions that cons pattern match each element of a list.<br>
