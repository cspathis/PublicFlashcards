Initialization in a declaration is allowed by the JVM only if ...	... the field is static and the initialization is to <tt>int</tt>, <tt>float</tt>, <tt>long</tt>, <tt>double</tt>, or <tt>String</tt>.
What is a method descriptor?<br><br>What is its syntax?	A type signature for a method.<br><br><pre>(type1...typen)typereturn</pre><br>No spaces.
Give the JVM notation for types.	B - byte<br>Z - boolean<br>C - char<br>D - double<br>F - float<br>I - int<br>J - long<br>S - short<br>V - void<br>[t - array of t<br>Lclassname; - reference to classname
How are names written on the JVM?	Fully qualified, using <tt>/</tt> instead of <tt>.</tt> to separate package names.
What happens to extra properties that are not in the spec?	The JVM is <em>required</em> to ignore them.
What keywords does the JVM allow on field, method, class, and interface declarations?	Those that Java does, in any order.
What flexibility overloading flexibility does the JVM have that Java prohibits?	Two methods that differ only in the return type. This is usable from assembly (since the full descriptor is used in a method call) but not from Java (where only the method's name is used).
