Where can named parameters be used?	All parameters can be used in a named way, whether or not default parameters are used.
What are the three ways of giving arguments to parameters?	Argument placement, named parameters, mixed mode.
What happens to default parameters when inheritence is used?	The parameter names are determined by the static type.<br>However, the values are determined by the dynamic type.<br><br>Hence in the case where an overriden function uses the same names as the <tt>super</tt> function, but in a different order, the result will be confusing for objects with a different static and dynamic types.
What is the negative consequence of named parameters?<br><br>What feature will will 2.8.1 probably include to mitigate this problem?	Parameter names are exposed and part of the public API.<br><br>Scala 2.8.1 will probably include a way to deprecate old parameter names and introduce new ones.
