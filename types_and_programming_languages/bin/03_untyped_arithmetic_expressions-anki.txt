What is a <em>metavariable</em>?	A variable that ranges over the <em>metalanguage</em> (the notation of a description), not the <em>object language</em> (the language being defined).
What is a <em>metatheory</em>?	"The collection of true statements that we can make about some particular logical system (or programming language)--and, by extension, the study of such statements."
Why can the definitions of language's syntax get away with not mentioning parentheses?	The definitions actually describe trees. Parens are simply a way of resolving ambiguities when a term is represented a string.
Name four ways to define the syntax of a language.	- Using a grammar, in BNF form for example.<br>- By defining terms inductively.<br>- Using inference rules.<br>- By defining a procedure for generating all possible phrases.
Inference rules with no premises are called ...	... <em>axioms</em>.
Why are inference rules actually <em>rule schemas</em>?	They may reference metavariables. Hence each may be instantiated to any of an infinite set of <em>concrete rules</em> containing phrases in place of metavariables.
What are the three primary approaches to formalizing a language's semantics?	- Operational semantics.<br>- Denotational semantics.<br>- Axiomatic semantics.
Define <em>operational semantics</em>.	An approach to formalizing semantics that specifies the behavior of a programming language by defining a simple abstract machine to it. The abstract machine uses the terms of the language itself (or higher level structures) as states and defines a transition function between states. The meaning of a term is the final state reached when starting with that term as the initial state.
In the framework of operational semantics, proofs on the behavior of a program amount to what?	Proofs of the correctness of the implementation of the language.
Define <em>denotational semantics</em>.	An approach to formalizing semantics that takes meanings of terms to be mathematical objects.
Giving a language denotational semantics involves what?	Finding a collection of <em>semantic domains</em> and then defining an <em>interpretation function</em> mapping terms into elements of these domains.
What is <em>domain theory</em>?	The search for appropriate semantic domains for modeling various language features.
Define <em>axiomatic semantics</em>.	An approach to formalizing semantics that takes laws themselves as the definition of the language. The meaning of a term is just what can be proved about it.
What are the most difficult cases for denotational and axiomatic semantics.	- Denotational semantics: nondeterminism and concurrency<br>- Axiomatic semantics: procedures
