* What is a ``metavariable``?
A variable that ranges over the ``metalanguage`` (the notation of a description), not the ``object language`` (the language being defined).

* What is a ``metatheory``?
"The collection of true statements that we can make about some particular logical system (or programming language)--and, by extension, the study of such statements."

* Why can the definitions of language's syntax get away with not mentioning parentheses?
The definitions actually describe trees. Parens are simply a way of resolving ambiguities when a term is represented a string.

* Name four ways to define the syntax of a language.
- Using a grammar, in BNF form for example.
- By defining terms inductively.
- Using inference rules.
- By defining a procedure for generating all possible phrases.

* Inference rules with no premises are called ...
... ``axioms``.

* Why are inference rules actually ``rule schemas``?
They may reference metavariables. Hence each may be instantiated to any of an infinite set of ``concrete rules`` containing phrases in place of metavariables.

* What are the three primary approaches to formalizing a language's semantics?
- Operational semantics.
- Denotational semantics.
- Axiomatic semantics.

* Define ``operation semantics``.
An approach to formalizing semantics that specifies the behavior of a programming language by defining a simple abstract machine to it. The abstract machine uses the terms of the language itself (or higher level structures) as states and defines a transition function between states. The meaning of a term is the final state reached when starting with that term as the initial state.

* In the framework of operational semantics, proofs on the behavior of a program amount to what?
Proofs of the correctness of the implementation of the language.

* Define ``denotational semantics``.
An approach to formalizing semantics that takes meanings of terms to be mathematical objects.

* Giving a language denotational semantics involves what?
Finding a collection of ``semantic domains`` and then defining an ``interpretation function`` mapping terms into elements of these domains.

* What is ``domain theory``?
The search for appropriate semantic domains for modeling various language features.

* Define ``axiomatic semantics``.
An approach to formalizing semantics that takes laws themselves as the definition of the language. The meaning of a term is just what can be proved about it.
