What is pre-emptive scheduling?	Scheduling that allows context switches before a thread blocks, to prevent CPU "hogging".
What is a dispatch loop?	An alternative to parallelism that subdivides tasks, saves their state, and returns to the top of the dispatch loop at every delay-inducing operation.
What are the three levels of parallelism granularity?<br><br>How can they be further categorized?	- Instruction-level<br>- Vector-level<br>- Thread-level<br><br>The first two are part of the implementation of a program, the third affects the program's high-level structure.
What are some motivations of concurrency?	- Capturing the logical structure of a problem.<br>- Exploiting extra processors for speed.<br>- Coping with separate physical devices.
What is a race condition?	A section of code that multiple threads approach ("race to"), such that the behavior of the program depends on which gets there first.
What is the purpose of synchronization?	To make a critical section appear atomic.
What is the memory coherence problem? Who does it affect?	The difficulty in keeping copies of a memory location consistent with one another.<br>This problem affects shared-memory machines.
What are the two broad categories of single-site (non-distributed) parallel computers?	- Multiprocessor (shared-memory) systems.<br>- Message-based systems.
Define <em>task</em>.	A well-defined unit of work that must be performed by some thread. In that sense a collection of threads share a "bag of tasks" to work on.
Contrast heavyweight and lightweight threads.	Lightweight threads have a shared memory space.
