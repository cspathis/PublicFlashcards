How do you import modules from the standard library?	Use the <tt>Require</tt> command.<br><tt>Require Import Arith.</tt>
How does the <tt>Require</tt> command work?	Looks for a compiled <tt>.vo</tt> file with the same name in the libraries Coq knows about. Paths use the same directory structure as the local operating system.
How can you let Coq know about new library paths?	<tt>Add LoadPath</tt>.
What is an absolute module name?	A sequence of single identifiers separated by dots.<br>E.g., <tt>Arith</tt> has full name <tt>Coq.Arith.Arith</tt>.
Why is loading compiled files quick?	The corresponding development is not type-checked again.
What does the <tt>Load</tt> command do?	Same as <tt>Require Import</tt>, but takes an uncompiled <tt>.v</tt> file instead of a compiled <tt>.vo</tt> file.
How can dependencies-of-dependencies be automatically resolved?	If you want a module M required in a module N to be automatically visible when N is required, you should use Require Export M in your module N.
How can you find the available facts concerning a predicate?	- <tt>SearchAbout</tt> command looks up all known facts concerning a given predicate.<br>- <tt>Search</tt> displays only lemmas that have the searched predicate as the head position in the conclusion.<br>- <tt>SearchPattern</tt> allows searching for theorems with a conclusion matching a given pattern, where <tt>_</tt> can be used in place of an arbitrary term.
