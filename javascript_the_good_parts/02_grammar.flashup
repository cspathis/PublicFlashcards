* Whitespace is ...
... not significant.

* What is the comment syntax?
* What's the catch?
As in Java, in-line `//` and multiline `/* ... */`.

Unfortunately, the multiline delimiters can appear in string literals, making commenting out arbitrary blocks of codes unreliable.

* What's strange about JavaScript's numerical types?
There are no integers, only 64-bit floating types.
