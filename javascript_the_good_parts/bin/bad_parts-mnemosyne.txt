Why should you prefer <tt>===</tt>/<tt>!==</tt> over <tt>==</tt>/<tt>!=</tt>.	<tt>==</tt>/<tt>!=</tt> will engage in non-intuitive non-transitive coercion.
What does <tt>void</tt> do?	It's a pointless operator that returns <tt>undefined</tt> regardless of its operand.
Why should <tt>with</tt> be avoided?	It's behavior cannot be predicted from reading the programming text.
Why should <tt>eval</tt> and similar string-evaluating functions be avoided?	They are slow and reduce the effectiveness of static analysis tools.
