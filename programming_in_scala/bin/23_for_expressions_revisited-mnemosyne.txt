What is the syntax of <tt>for</tt> expressions essentially equivalent to?	Common operations of database query languages.
Which methods are used to rewrite <tt>for</tt> syntax?	aka <tt>for</tt> expression with yield:<tt>map</tt>, <tt>flatMap</tt>, <tt>filter</tt>.<br><br>Without: <tt>foreach</tt>, <tt>filter</tt>.<br>aka <tt>for</tt> loop.
What are <tt>for</tt> expressions often used for?	Creating a new collection from an old one.
Describe filter form.	<tt>if expr</tt><br><br><tt>expr</tt> is an expression resulting in a Boolean.<br><br>Filter drops from iteration the values for which <tt>expr</tt> returns	<tt>False</tt>.
Describe generator form.<br><br>How does it work?	<tt>pat <- expr</tt><br><br><tt>pat</tt> is matched one-by-one against elements of <tt>expr</tt>, typically a List, but no <tt>MatchError</tt> is thrown; the element is simply discarded.<br><br>If <tt>pat</tt> is just a variable, the result will be simple iteration.
When does translation of <tt>for</tt> expressions happen?	Before type checking. The only result of expansion must type check.<br><br><tt>map</tt>, <tt>flatMap</tt>, <tt>filter</tt>, and <tt>foreach</tt> don't need and particular signature.
Give the general <tt>for</tt> expression syntax.	<tt>for (seq) yield expr</tt><br><br><tt>seq</tt> is a sequence of generators, definitions, and filters, with semicolons between elements.<br><br><tt>seq</tt> starts with a generator.
Describe generator form.	<tt>pat = expr</tt><br><br>This binds pattern <tt>pat</tt> to the value of <tt>expr</tt>.<br><br>The most common case is defining a simple variable x.<br><br>Note there is not necessarily a val. Simple variable binding will be the same as <tt>val x = expr</tt>.
What are the rules for introducing <tt>for</tt> expression support to new types?	If your type defines just <tt>Map</tt> it allows expressions with a single generator.<br><br>If it defines <tt>flatMap + map</tt> it allows expressions with multiple generators.<br><br>If it defines <tt>foreach</tt> it allows <tt>for</tt> loops (both with single and multiple generators).<br><br>If it defines <tt>filter</tt> it allows for filter expressions.
