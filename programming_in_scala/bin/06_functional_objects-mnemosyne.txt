What is a mixed identifier?	It's an alphanumeric identifier followed by underscore followed by an operator identifier.
Where can you invoke superclass constructors?	They can only be invoked by the primary constructor in the extends statement.
What do class parameters correspond to in Java?	They correspond to the primary constructor, along with all code not in a method or field.
Name four advantages of immutable objects.	- They are easier to reason about, since they don't change.<br>- They can be passed around freely without defensive copies.<br>- They are inherently thread safe.<br>- They are safe hash table keys.
What are Scala constants used for?<br><br>What is their case convention?	They are used for a subset of <tt>val</tt>s. Constants would generally not change even between program executions.<br><br>Case convention is not caps, just CamelCase.
What are operator identifiers?<br><br>How are they implemented?	They are one or more operator characters.<br><br>They are internally mangled by Scala as <tt>$char</tt> for each character.<br><br>e.g., <tt>+</tt>, <tt><?></tt>, <tt>:-></tt>
Describe an alphanumeric identifier.	It starts with a letter or underscore, followed by further letters, digits, or underscores. <tt>$</tt> counts as a letter but should not be used to avoid colliding with the compiler.
How is method overloading resolved?	By finding the method with the best static type match to arguments.<br><br>If there is no unique best-matching version, will return "ambiguous reference" error.
What are magic numbers?	They are literal values with no explanation which, in the worst case, appear multiple times.
Enforce preconditions.	<tt>Predef.require(Boolean)</tt><br><br>This throws <tt>IllegalArgumentException</tt>.
What is a literal identifier?<br><br>What does it do?	It is enclosed by back ticks.<br><br>It forces identifier interpretation even over keyword or other restrictions.
Name four kinds of identifiers.	- Alphanumeric identifier.<br>- Operator identifier.<br>- Mixed identifier.<br>- Literal identifier.
