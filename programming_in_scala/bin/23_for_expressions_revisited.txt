What is the syntax of <tt>for</tt> expressions essentially equivalent to?<br>	Common operations of database query languages.<br>
Which methods are used to rewrite <tt>for</tt> syntax?<br>	aka <tt>for</tt> expression with yield:<tt>map</tt>, <tt>flatMap</tt>, <tt>filter</tt>.<br><br>Without: <tt>foreach</tt>, <tt>filter</tt>.<br>aka <tt>for</tt> loop.<br>
What are <tt>for</tt> expressions often used for?<br>	Creating a new collection from an old one.<br>
Describe filter form.<br>	<tt>if expr</tt><br><br><tt>expr</tt> is an expression resulting in a Boolean.<br><br>Filter drops from iteration the values for which <tt>expr</tt> returns	<tt>False</tt>.<br>
Describe generator form.<br>How does it work?<br>	<tt>pat <- expr</tt><br><br><tt>pat</tt> is matched one-by-one against elements of <tt>expr</tt>, typically a List, but no <tt>MatchError</tt> is thrown; the element is simply discarded.<br><br>If <tt>pat</tt> is just a variable, the result will be simple iteration.<br>
When does translation of <tt>for</tt> expressions happen?<br>	Before type checking. The only result of expansion must type check.<br><br><tt>map</tt>, <tt>flatMap</tt>, <tt>filter</tt>, and <tt>foreach</tt> don't need and particular signature.<br>
Give the general <tt>for</tt> expression syntax.<br>	<tt>for (seq) yield expr</tt><br><br><tt>seq</tt> is a sequence of generators, definitions, and filters, with semicolons between elements.<br><br><tt>seq</tt> starts with a generator.<br>
Describe generator form.<br>	<tt>pat = expr</tt><br><br>This binds pattern <tt>pat</tt> to the value of <tt>expr</tt>.<br><br>The most common case is defining a simple variable x.<br><br>Note there is not necessarily a val. Simple variable binding will be the same as <tt>val x = expr</tt>.<br>
What are the rules for introducing <tt>for</tt> expression support to new types?<br>	If your type defines just <tt>Map</tt> it allows expressions with a single generator.<br><br>If it defines <tt>flatMap + map</tt> it allows expressions with multiple generators.<br><br>If it defines <tt>foreach</tt> it allows <tt>for</tt> loops (both with single and multiple generators).<br><br>If it defines <tt>filter</tt> it allows for filter expressions.<br>
