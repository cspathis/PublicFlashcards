What do specs and ScalaTest support?	They support behavior-driven development, emphasizing human-readable specifications of behavior of code with accompanying test cases.
Enable/disable <tt>assert()</tt> and <tt>ensuring()</tt>.	JVM's -ea and -da flags.
List the two forms of <tt>assert()</tt>.	- <tt>assert(Boolean)</tt><br><br>- <tt>assert(Boolean, String)</tt> (explanation to be included in <tt>AssertionError</tt>.)
Describe the test directory hierarchy.	It typically mirrors the source tree's directory hierarchy.
How can you get more informative failure reporting than <tt>assert()</tt>?	ScalaTest's<br><pre>assert(this === that)expect(this) {  that}</pre>
Verify exception thrown, using ScalaTest.	<pre>intercept[IllegalArgumentException] {  //something that throws it}</pre>
Give a more Scala-esque way to use ScalaTest.	extend <tt>org.scalatest.FunSuite</tt><br><br><pre>  test("my cool test") {    //use assert() or exceptions  }</pre>
Compare specs and <tt>org.scalatest.Spec</tt>.	Specs provides matches to be used in ScalaTest or JUnit.<br><br>ScalaTest's Spec uses<br><pre>describe("some object") {  it("should do A") {    //test for A  }}</pre>
What does ScalaCheck support?	Property-based testing.<br><br>You give properties with implication operator ==>, and it checks the properties on the values it generates for you.
Concisely check the conditions of method's result.	Use <tt>ensuring(op: Any => Boolean)</tt><br><br>Raises <tt>AssertionError</tt> if predicate fails, and returns the argument correctly cast to result type of function otherwise.<br><br><tt>ensuring(_.dollars >= 0)</tt><br>Result of function will be inserted and returned if the predicate holds.
