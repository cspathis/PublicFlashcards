Achieve a multiline statement with operators <em>without</em> the semicolon inferer getting it wrong.<br>	<pre>(x<br>+ y)<br></pre><br>or<br><br><pre>x +<br>y<br></pre>
Explain the rules of semicolon inference.<br>	The end of the line is treaded as a semicolon unless<br>- the line ends with a token that isn't a legal end of a statement, like a period or infix operator.<br>- the next line starts with a token that can't start a statement.<br>- the line ends while in <tt>(...)</tt> or <tt>[...]</tt>.<br>
Where do Java static methods go in Scala?<br>	In singletons.<br>
What are three reasons why the <tt>Application</tt> trait is bad?<br>	- It allows no access to command line arguments.<br>- Treading limitations make it bad for multithreaded programs.<br>- HotSpot doesn't optimize an object executed by the <tt>Application</tt> trait.<br>
Describe the compile daemon.<br>	Start and compile: <tt>fsc</tt><br>Stop: <tt>fsc -shutdown</tt><br>
What do companion object and class have access to?<br>	Each other's private members.<br>
What is automatically imported into every Scala program?<br>	<pre>scala._<br>scala.Predef._<br>java.lang._<br></pre>
What can a singleton not do?<br>	It cannot define a new Scala type, but it can still be an instance of a superclass, trait, or companion class.<br>
What is a singleton object without a companion class called?<br>	It's called a standalone object.<br>
When does a method have a side effect?<br>	If it mutates a state outside a method or performs i/o.<br>
What is a companion object?<br>	It's a singleton object with the same name as the class it shares a source file with.<br>
When is a file a script?<br>	When it ends in a result expression.<br>
What kind of variable are parameters?<br>	They are <tt>val</tt>s.<br>
Singleton objects have the initialization semantics of what in Java?<br>	Statics.<br>
What in Scala is similar to Java's void return type?<br>	<tt>Unit</tt><br>
What is the default visibility level in Scala?<br>	Public. Achieved by leaving off the visibility modifier.<br>
What is the program entry point?<br>	A singleton object with <tt>main</tt> method that takes <tt>Array[String]</tt>.<br><br>The result type is irrelevant.<br>
Describe a good caching data structure.<br>	<tt>scala.collection.jcl.WeakHashMap</tt><br>
What happens if you leave off <tt>=</tt> before the function body?<br>	The result type automatically becomes <tt>Unit</tt>.<br>
