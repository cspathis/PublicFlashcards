What is the orientation of grouping within a precedence level?	It reads left-to-right, or right-to-left if ending in <tt>:</tt>.
What does operator notation require?<br><br>How is multi-arg calling done?	It requires a receiving object, e.g.<br><tt>Console println 10</tt><br><strong>not</strong> <tt>println 10</tt><br><br>Multi-arg calling is done with parens:<br><tt>s indexOf ('0',5)</tt>
What are the available prefix operators?	+, -, !, ~<br><br>You can prepend unary_ to any of the four.
Describe Symbol literals.	- <tt>'cymbal</tt> is expanded to <tt>Symbol("cymbal")</tt>.<br>- They must be alphanumeric.<br>- Values are interned. Symbol literal twice will refer to the exact same symbol object.
What does unary + do on numeric types?	Absolutely nothing.
What are postfix operators?	They are just methods that take no arguments when called without a dot or parens.
Correct the spacing of multiline triple-quoted strings.	<pre>println("""| Some really long<br>           | string""".stripMargin)</pre>
What is the order of operand evaluation?	It's always left-to-right, regardless of associativity.
What is short-circuiting accomplished with?	By-name parameters.
Give the  method precedence table.	Method precedence is done by the first letter of the method name. Assignment operators are done by the last letter (ending in =).<br><br><pre> * / %<br> + -<br> :<br> = !<br> < ><br> &<br> ^<br> |<br> (all letters)<br> (all assignment operators)</pre>
