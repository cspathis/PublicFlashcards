Unlike in Ruby, Scala ranges don't infer ...	... direction. The step is always positive 1.
What unexpected type provides <tt>to</tt>?	<tt>Char</tt>
Functional languages often use tuples in place of what?	Classes. Scala idiomatically uses them to replace data-heavy classes.
How do you get the intersection between two <tt>Sets</tt>?	<pre>(scala> Set(1, 3) & Set(3, 4)res11: scala.collection.immutable.Set[Int] = Set(3),true)</pre>
Give the signature of <tt>List</tt>'s <tt>sortWith</tt> function.	<pre>(def sort(lessThan: (A, A) => Boolean): List[A],true)</pre>
What's the difference between <tt>/:</tt> and <tt>foldLeft</tt>?	The order of arguments:<br><br><pre>((1 /: list) {(product, factor) => product * factor},true)</pre><br><br><pre>(list.foldLeft(1)((product, factor) => product * factor),true)</pre>
How does Scala allow XML searching?	- With an XPath-like language, replacing <tt>/</tt> and <tt>//</tt> with <tt>\</tt> and <tt>\\</tt>.<br>- Attributes can be searched for using an <tt>@</tt> in the search string.<br>- <tt>"_"</tt> matches every node.
